In this directory is a higher-order symplectic numerical integrator.

It can integrate one orbit of the Kepler problem in 15 milliseconds on
a several-years-old laptop, returning to the starting position and
velocity with an accuracy of one part in 10^15 or so ... which is not
too shabby.  It can also handle many other tasks, and can easily be
extended.

The C++ code you see here is derived from the Fortran programs created
by Ernst Hairer et al.  See
  http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html

The Fortran was translated to C++ using "f2c".

It was then slightly cleaned up and restructured, but much of it is
still basically Fortran-style code, so please don't complain that it
is not "elegant" C++.  The point is, now you can make it gradually
more elegant if you want, whereas the Fortran code was never going to
get any better.

A rudimentary command-line-interface has been added, so that a few
parameters can be adjusted without recompiling.

Things are now structured so that various "tasks" (i.e.  systems of
equations of motion) can easily be added to (or removed from) the
program.  For example, kepler.o can be linked to the executable or
not, and the program works either way.

To add your own task, copy kepler.c and modify it to do what you want.
You must start by changing the class name from "kepler_item" to
"your_new_item" or some such, so it won't conflict.  Also add your
new file to the list of sources in the makefile.
