/*    rkf45 is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff */
/*    differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive. */

/*             dy(i)/dt = f(t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neqn)) */
/*              where the y(i) are given at t . */
/*    typically the subroutine is used to integrate from t to tout but it */
/*    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a */
/*    single step in the direction of tout.  on return the parameters in */
/*    the call list are set for continuing the integration. the user has */
/*    only to call rkf45 again (and perhaps define a new value for tout). */
/*    actually, rkf45 is an interfacing routine which calls subroutine */
/*    rkfs for the solution.  rkfs in turn calls subroutine  fehl which */
/*    computes an approximate solution over one step. */

/*    rkf45  uses the runge-kutta-fehlberg (4,5)  method described */
/*    in the reference */
/*    e.fehlberg , low-order classical runge-kutta formulas with stepsize */
/*                 control , nasa tr r-315 */

/*    the performance of rkf45 is illustrated in the reference */

/*            rkf45 returns with iflag=2 if continuation is possible. */
/*      relerr,abserr -- relative and absolute local error tolerances */
/*            which must be non-negative. relerr must be a variable while */

/*    mode (iflag=-2) the user must keep in mind that each step taken is */
/*    in the direction of the current tout. upon reaching tout (indicated */
/*    by changing iflag to 2),the user must then define a new tout and */
/*    reset iflag to -2 to continue in the one-step integrator mode. */

/*    if the integration was not completed but the user still wants to */
/*    continue (iflag=3,4 cases), he just calls rkf45 again. with iflag=3 */
/*    the relerr parameter has been adjusted appropriately for continuing */
/*    the integration. in the case of iflag=4 the function counter will */
/*    be reset to 0 and another 3000 function evaluations are allowed. */

/*    however,in the case iflag=5, the user must first alter the error */
/*    criterion to use a positive value of abserr before integration can */
/*    proceed. if he does not,execution is terminated. */

/*    also,in the case iflag=6, it is necessary for the user to reset */
/*    iflag to 2 (or -2 when the one-step integration mode is being used) */
/*    as well as increasing either abserr,relerr or both before the */
/*    integration can be continued. if this is not done, execution will */
/*    be terminated. the occurrence of iflag=6 indicates a trouble spot */
/*    (solution is changing rapidly,singularity may be present) and it */
/*    often is inadvisable to continue. */

/*    if iflag=7 is encountered, the user should use the one-step */
/*    integration mode with the stepsize determined by the code or */
/*    consider switching to the adams codes de/step,intrp. if the user */
/*    insists upon continuing the integration with rkf45, he must reset */
/*    iflag to 2 before calling rkf45 again. otherwise,execution will be */
/*    terminated. */

/*    if iflag=8 is obtained, integration can not be continued unless */
/*    the invalid input parameters are corrected. */
